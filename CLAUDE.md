## What this project does

## Priorities

- Minimise AWS costs.
- Prefer simple, serverless, pay per use AWS services.
- Prefer AWS free tier eligible services where suitable.


## Allowed technologies

- Preference for SQL and Python.
- Use Terraform for infrastructure as code.
- Use AWS as cloud provider.

## Engineering rules

- Jobs should be idempotent.
- Never hardcode secrets, tokens or passwords.
- Keep code and architecture simple.

## Git workflow

- After completing any code change, always create a new branch, commit the changes, and raise a PR without waiting to be asked.
- Do not commit directly to main branch.
